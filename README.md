# [InstaScaler](https://instascaler.com/):

### What I like:

- The idea:
	- targeting an important field and using AI technologies to make it very useful, simple and automated to target the largest number of clients, this is what intelligent people do!

- Automation:
	- Fully _automated_
	- The fully _self-serve_ platform
	- Using automation to target anyone doing business even if he has no technical or marketing skills!


- Simplicity:
	- The **SIMPLE** design of the website
	- I'm sure that the dashboard and the platform will be even simpler as I can indicate from iOS App pics!

- Synchronization:
	- availability on both web and mobile.

- The Guides:
	- the provided instruction to use the platform
	- videos and resources that help people to start using the platform easily

- Support:
	- _Live Chat_: providing the website with a live chat and caring about the customer support
	- _FAQ_ with all the questions/answers that might come into mind before using the platform


### What I dislike:

- Prices:
	- I think the prices are somewhat high

- Demo:
	- providing a demo to enable people to discover the platform before making contact


### ideas:

- [ ] Provide a **_Demo/trail_** for users before they buy the product
- [ ] **Focus** on social media marketing as I have noticed that you are not marketing for the product so well on the social media like e.g. Facebook
